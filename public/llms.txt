### Calculator Questions

**How do I calculate molar mass?**
Enter a chemical formula (e.g., H2SO4, NaCl, C6H12O6) into the Molar Mass Calculator. It automatically calculates molecular weight by summing atomic masses x subscripts. For H2O: (2 x 1.008) + (1 x 15.999) = 18.015 g/mol.

**How do I balance a chemical equation?**
Enter your unbalanced equation (e.g., H2 + O2 -> H2O) into the Equation Balancer. It uses algebraic matrix methods to find the smallest whole-number coefficients. Balanced result: 2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O.

**What is the Ideal Gas Law formula?**
The Ideal Gas Law is PV = nRT, where P = pressure, V = volume, n = moles of gas, R = gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K or 0.0821 L*atm/mol*K), and T = temperature in Kelvin.

**How do I calculate pH from concentration?**
pH = -log[H+]. For a 0.01 M HCl solution: pH = -log(0.01) = 2. For bases, calculate pOH first, then pH = 14 - pOH.

**What is a limiting reagent?**
A limiting reagent is the reactant completely consumed first in a chemical reaction, determining the maximum amount of product that can form. VerChem identifies limiting reagents and calculates theoretical yield, actual yield, and percent yield.

**How do I convert moles to grams?**
Mass (g) = Moles x Molar Mass (g/mol). For 2 moles of water: 2 mol x 18.015 g/mol = 36.03 g.

### Organic Chemistry Questions

**What functional groups does VerChem cover?**
VerChem covers 22 functional groups across 7 categories: hydrocarbons (alkane, alkene, alkyne, arene), oxygen-containing (alcohol, aldehyde, ketone, carboxylic acid, ester, ether, epoxide, phenol), nitrogen-containing (amine, amide, nitrile, imine, nitro), sulfur-containing (thiol), halogen-containing (alkyl halide, acyl halide), and carbonyl-derived (anhydride). Each includes structure, properties, spectroscopy data (IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR), and common reactions.

**What named reactions are in VerChem?**
VerChem includes 40 named organic reactions at three difficulty levels: Introductory (SN1, SN2, E1, E2, Markovnikov/anti-Markovnikov addition, halogenation, hydrogenation, hydration, Fischer esterification, saponification, radical halogenation, dehydration, EAS, hydroboration-oxidation), Intermediate (Grignard, Aldol, Wittig, Diels-Alder, Claisen, Michael, Friedel-Crafts, Williamson, Jones/PCC/Swern oxidation, NaBH4/LiAlH4/Wolff-Kishner reduction), and Advanced (Suzuki, Heck, Sonogashira, Grubbs metathesis, Sharpless epoxidation, Beckmann, Baeyer-Villiger, Robinson annulation, Mannich, Sandmeyer).

**How does the Reaction Predictor work?**
Select a starting functional group and a reagent/condition. VerChem predicts the product based on known organic reaction rules. It shows the product functional group, mechanism type, explanation of what happens, and selectivity information (e.g., Markovnikov vs anti-Markovnikov).

### VerChem vs AI Comparison

**What is the difference between VerChem and asking AI like ChatGPT for chemistry calculations?**
VerChem and AI chatbots serve different purposes. VerChem provides 100% accurate calculations every time using verified formulas and NIST/IUPAC certified data - the same result guaranteed on every calculation. AI chatbots like ChatGPT are excellent for explanations and learning concepts, but may occasionally make calculation errors (hallucination), give inconsistent results, or use outdated atomic masses. For critical calculations (lab work, exams, engineering), use VerChem. For understanding concepts, AI chatbots are great companions. Best practice: Use both together.

**Can AI chatbots replace chemistry calculators like VerChem?**
No, they serve complementary roles. AI chatbots may: 1) Calculate atomic masses incorrectly (off by 1-2 decimal places), 2) Make errors in complex equation balancing, 3) Give different answers each time you ask, 4) Not know specialized standards like Thai PCD water quality limits. VerChem guarantees: 1) NIST-certified atomic masses for all 118 elements, 2) Deterministic results (same input = same output, always), 3) Calculation speed under 50ms, 4) Thai regulatory standards built-in. Use VerChem when accuracy matters, AI when you need explanations.

**Why does VerChem exist if AI can do chemistry?**
AI is great at explaining concepts but unreliable for calculations. VerChem was built because: 1) Students need tools they can trust for exams, 2) Engineers need accurate calculations for real-world applications, 3) Thai environmental standards (PCD Type A/B/C) are not in most AI training data, 4) Consistency matters - same calculation should give same result every time. VerChem + AI together = best learning experience.

### Spectroscopy Questions

**How do I interpret an IR spectrum?**
Enter the wavenumber of your IR absorption peak (in cm⁻¹) into VerChem's IR Spectrum Interpreter. It identifies the functional group based on 34 known IR absorptions. Key regions: O-H stretch (3200-3550 cm⁻¹), N-H stretch (3300-3500 cm⁻¹), C-H stretch (2850-3300 cm⁻¹), C=O stretch (1650-1800 cm⁻¹), C=C stretch (1600-1680 cm⁻¹). The tool includes a visual correlation chart and quick presets for common functional groups.

**How do I use NMR chemical shifts?**
Enter a chemical shift value in ppm into VerChem's NMR Analyzer. For ¹H NMR: TMS reference at 0 ppm, alkyl H (0.8-1.5 ppm), vinyl H (4.5-6.5 ppm), aromatic H (6.5-8.5 ppm), aldehyde H (9-10 ppm), carboxylic acid H (10-13 ppm). For ¹³C NMR: alkyl C (0-50 ppm), aromatic C (110-160 ppm), carbonyl C (170-220 ppm). Includes 7 common NMR solvent references (CDCl3, DMSO-d6, D2O, etc.).

**What is the nitrogen rule in mass spectrometry?**
The nitrogen rule states that molecules with an odd molecular weight contain an odd number of nitrogen atoms, and molecules with an even molecular weight contain zero or an even number of nitrogen atoms. VerChem's Mass Spec Analyzer includes a nitrogen rule checker, fragment loss identifier (26 common losses like -18 for H2O, -28 for CO), isotope pattern predictor for Cl/Br-containing compounds, and common ion reference.

### Lab & Practical Questions

**How do I prepare a dilution?**
Use the dilution equation C₁V₁ = C₂V₂. VerChem's Solution Preparation Calculator solves for any unknown variable. Example: To dilute 1.0 M HCl to 0.1 M in 100 mL, you need V₁ = (0.1 M × 100 mL) / 1.0 M = 10 mL of stock solution, then add water to 100 mL. The calculator supports 11 concentration units (mol/L, g/L, mg/L, ppm, ppb, %w/v, %w/w, %v/v, normality, mmol/L, μg/L).

**What do GHS pictograms mean?**
GHS (Globally Harmonized System) uses 9 pictograms to classify chemical hazards: Flame (flammable), Oxidizer (may cause fire), Compressed Gas, Corrosion, Skull & Crossbones (acute toxicity), Exclamation Mark (irritant), Health Hazard (chronic), Environment (aquatic toxicity), Exploding Bomb. VerChem's Lab Safety tool includes all 9 with hazard classes, signal words, and example chemicals.

**Which chemicals are incompatible for storage?**
VerChem's Chemical Compatibility Checker covers 11 chemical groups: strong acids, strong bases, oxidizers, reducers, flammables, water-reactive, organic peroxides, compressed gases, toxic substances, corrosives, and pyrophorics. Key incompatibilities: strong acids + strong bases (violent reaction), oxidizers + flammables (fire/explosion), water-reactive + aqueous solutions (gas/heat generation).

### Nuclear & Quantum Questions

**How do I calculate radioactive decay?**
Use N(t) = N₀ × (1/2)^(t/t½), where N₀ is the initial amount, t is time, and t½ is the half-life. VerChem's Nuclear Chemistry Calculator handles decay calculations, activity (A = λN), specific activity, and includes 23 common isotopes (H-3, C-14, I-131, Co-60, U-235, U-238, Pu-239, etc.) with their half-lives and decay types (alpha, beta⁻, beta⁺, gamma, electron capture).

**What is binding energy per nucleon?**
Binding energy per nucleon measures nuclear stability. It is calculated from the mass defect: BE = Δm × c². The most stable nuclei (Fe-56, Ni-62) have the highest BE/nucleon (~8.8 MeV). VerChem calculates binding energy for any nucleus given Z (protons) and A (mass number).

**What are valid quantum numbers?**
Four quantum numbers describe an electron: n (principal, 1,2,3...), l (angular, 0 to n-1), ml (magnetic, -l to +l), ms (spin, +½ or -½). VerChem's Quantum Number Validator checks all rules and shows the orbital name. Example: n=3, l=2, ml=-1, ms=+½ → valid (3d orbital). The tool also calculates de Broglie wavelength (λ = h/mv), hydrogen energy levels (En = -13.6/n² eV), and visualizes s, p, d orbital shapes.

### Periodic Table Questions

**How many elements are in the periodic table?**
There are 118 confirmed elements. Elements 1-94 occur naturally (some like Technetium and Promethium are extremely rare). Elements 95-118 are synthetic, created in laboratories.

**What are rare earth elements?**
Rare earth elements include 17 elements: Scandium (Sc), Yttrium (Y), and the 15 Lanthanides (La-Lu). Despite the name, most are not rare but are difficult to separate from each other.
