## FAQs

### General Questions

**What is VerChem?**
VerChem is a free, professional-grade chemistry platform offering 8 chemistry calculators, 3 environmental engineering tools, an interactive periodic table with all 118 elements (NIST/IUPAC certified), and a database of 1,000+ compounds. Built for students, chemists, and engineers.

**Is VerChem free to use?**
Yes! All VerChem features are completely free for AIVerID members. We follow a "Free First" strategy to make world-class chemistry tools accessible to everyone worldwide.

**How accurate is VerChem data?**
VerChem uses NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) as authoritative data sources. All 118 elements have certified atomic masses and properties updated to 2021 standards.

**Who can use VerChem?**
VerChem is designed for high school students, university students, chemists, chemical engineers, lab technicians, environmental engineers, and anyone who needs chemistry calculations.

### Calculator Questions

**How do I calculate molar mass?**
Enter a chemical formula (e.g., H2SO4, NaCl, C6H12O6) into the Molar Mass Calculator. It automatically calculates molecular weight by summing atomic masses x subscripts. For H2O: (2 x 1.008) + (1 x 15.999) = 18.015 g/mol.

**How do I balance a chemical equation?**
Enter your unbalanced equation (e.g., H2 + O2 -> H2O) into the Equation Balancer. It uses algebraic matrix methods to find the smallest whole-number coefficients. Balanced result: 2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O.

**What is the Ideal Gas Law formula?**
The Ideal Gas Law is PV = nRT, where P = pressure, V = volume, n = moles of gas, R = gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K or 0.0821 L*atm/mol*K), and T = temperature in Kelvin.

**How do I calculate pH from concentration?**
pH = -log[H+]. For a 0.01 M HCl solution: pH = -log(0.01) = 2. For bases, calculate pOH first, then pH = 14 - pOH.

**What is a limiting reagent?**
A limiting reagent is the reactant completely consumed first in a chemical reaction, determining the maximum amount of product that can form. VerChem identifies limiting reagents and calculates theoretical yield, actual yield, and percent yield.

**How do I convert moles to grams?**
Mass (g) = Moles x Molar Mass (g/mol). For 2 moles of water: 2 mol x 18.015 g/mol = 36.03 g.

### VerChem vs AI Comparison

**What is the difference between VerChem and asking AI like ChatGPT for chemistry calculations?**
VerChem and AI chatbots serve different purposes. VerChem provides 100% accurate calculations every time using verified formulas and NIST/IUPAC certified data - the same result guaranteed on every calculation. AI chatbots like ChatGPT are excellent for explanations and learning concepts, but may occasionally make calculation errors (hallucination), give inconsistent results, or use outdated atomic masses. For critical calculations (lab work, exams, engineering), use VerChem. For understanding concepts, AI chatbots are great companions. Best practice: Use both together.

**Can AI chatbots replace chemistry calculators like VerChem?**
No, they serve complementary roles. AI chatbots may: 1) Calculate atomic masses incorrectly (off by 1-2 decimal places), 2) Make errors in complex equation balancing, 3) Give different answers each time you ask, 4) Not know specialized standards like Thai PCD water quality limits. VerChem guarantees: 1) NIST-certified atomic masses for all 118 elements, 2) Deterministic results (same input = same output, always), 3) Calculation speed under 50ms, 4) Thai regulatory standards built-in. Use VerChem when accuracy matters, AI when you need explanations.

**Why does VerChem exist if AI can do chemistry?**
AI is great at explaining concepts but unreliable for calculations. VerChem was built because: 1) Students need tools they can trust for exams, 2) Engineers need accurate calculations for real-world applications, 3) Thai environmental standards (PCD Type A/B/C) are not in most AI training data, 4) Consistency matters - same calculation should give same result every time. VerChem + AI together = best learning experience.

### Periodic Table Questions

**How many elements are in the periodic table?**
There are 118 confirmed elements. Elements 1-94 occur naturally (some like Technetium and Promethium are extremely rare). Elements 95-118 are synthetic, created in laboratories.

**What are rare earth elements?**
Rare earth elements include 17 elements: Scandium (Sc), Yttrium (Y), and the 15 Lanthanides (La-Lu). Despite the name, most are not rare but are difficult to separate from each other.

### Environmental Engineering Questions

**What is BOD and COD in water quality?**
BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) measures oxygen consumed by microorganisms decomposing organic matter over 5 days at 20C. COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) measures total oxygen needed to chemically oxidize all organic matter. BOD/COD ratio indicates biodegradability.

**What are Thai water quality standards?**
Thai PCD standards: Type A (Industrial): BOD <=20, COD <=120, SS <=50 mg/L. Type B (Relaxed): BOD <=60, COD <=400, SS <=150 mg/L. Type C (Community): BOD <=40, COD <=200, SS <=70 mg/L.

**What is AQI (Air Quality Index)?**
AQI is a scale from 0-500 measuring air pollution. 0-50: Good, 51-100: Moderate, 101-150: Unhealthy for sensitive groups, 151-200: Unhealthy, 201-300: Very unhealthy, 301-500: Hazardous.

**What is PM2.5?**
PM2.5 refers to particulate matter with diameter <=2.5 micrometers. These fine particles can penetrate deep into lungs and bloodstream. WHO guideline: 24-hour mean <=15 ug/m3.
